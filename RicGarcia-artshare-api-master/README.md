## artshare-api

A very simple Sinatra API to teach front end developers how to integrate a front end with an existing API.

For a full README, start the app by changing directory to the main project directory and running bundle install. Then, run rackup to start the server. Go to localhost:9292 to see the documentation in the browser.

You must have Ruby installed.
